*Editable HTML to clipboard* is a Chrome browser extension that lets you copy
the HTML contents of rich text fields to the clipboard, so you can edit them
with your favorite code editor, then paste them back into the rich text input.

This is particularly useful when writing email, e.g. in Gmail, Yahoo Mail,
Outlookâ€¦

The *copy HTML source to clipboard* and *paste HTML source from clipboard*
options are available through a context menu (right click) and via keyboard
shortcuts (``Ctrl+.`` and ``Ctrl+Shift+.``). These work only on rich text fields
(technically: ``contenteditable`` HTML elements), and plain text multiline
inputs (``<textarea>`` HTML elements).

Usage
-----

1. Install the browser extension from its `Chrome Web Store page`_.

2. Refresh the page you're working on.

3. Right click inside your editable field and click the *Editable HTML to
   clipboard* actions. Alternatively, use keyboard shortcuts ``Ctrl+.`` and
   ``Ctrl+Shift+.``.

History
-------

I created this extension in replacement for the one I was using previously:
`Text-Aid-Too`_. Since 2025 it's not supported by the Chrome Web Store, and its
implementation and installation was more complex.
